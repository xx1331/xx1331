Note's : 

Linear Algebra :

can be used to create model's of natural phenomenon. Unlike nonlinear system's which cannot be modeled by linear algebra. can be used for first order approximation's in non linear system's though. vector space's in linear algebra are prefered because they are easy to use and generally prefered because of syntheticism.
