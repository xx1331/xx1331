Note's : 

Linear Algebra :

can be used to create model's of natural phenomenon. Unlike nonlinear system's which cannot be modeled by linear algebra. can be used for first order approximation's in non linear system's though. vector space's in linear algebra are prefered because they are easy to use and generally prefered because of syntheticism.

In vector space's v + w mean's that if w is added to v then there will be a third binary operation or vector which w create's. 
That's why in open gl vertex 3f is already a matrix of real number's thus w is not needed. In scalar multiplication scalar's shrink vector's.
in scalar multiplication, they stretch, shrink, or flip vectors.
vector space's are set's of vector's and not vector's them self's.
axiom's are like rule's that vector's are to follow to correctly equaze.
vector's represent the length or magnitude of an arrow or point from a to in linear algebra.

Field's :

field's are coresponding number's that are used to operate on rational and real number system's

Complex number's :

are element's that cannot be satisfied by real number's and thus are very easy to use in equation's and represent a numbersystem that extend's real number's.
